## Ola Driver Retention and Performance Project

### Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting driver retention and performance based on various factors such as age, gender, education, income, and business value. The dataset contains records of 19,104 drivers, including their joining details, income, and quarterly performance ratings. The goal is to analyze and model factors that influence drivers' success and retention rates at Ola.

### Dataset Information

- **File Name**: `ola_driver_scaler.csv`
- **Total Records**: 19,104
- **Total Features**: 14

The features in the dataset are as follows:

|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unnamed: 0**         | Index of the data                                                        |
| **MMM-YY**             | Month and year of the data                                               |
| **Driver_ID**          | Unique identification number for the driver                              |
| **Age**                | Age of the driver                                                        |
| **Gender**             | Gender of the driver (0 = Male, 1 = Female)                              |
| **City**               | Code representing the city                                               |
| **Education_Level**    | Driver's education level (Ordinal encoding)                              |
| **Income**             | Driver's income                                                          |
| **Dateofjoining**      | Date when the driver joined the company                                   |
| **LastWorkingDate**    | Last working date of the driver (if applicable)                          |
| **Joining Designation**| Driver's designation at the time of joining                              |
| **Grade**              | Grade level assigned to the driver                                       |
| **Total Business Value**| Business value generated by the driver                                  |
| **Quarterly Rating**   | Driver's performance rating per quarter                                  |

### Key Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore patterns in the data such as age distribution, city performance, and retention factors.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values in columns like `Age`, `Gender`, and `LastWorkingDate`. Convert relevant fields such as `MMM-YY` to a date format for better time-based analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features like tenure, calculate the difference between `Dateofjoining` and `LastWorkingDate`, and categorize drivers based on performance metrics.
4. **Modeling**: Apply machine learning models to predict the `Quarterly Rating` and understand the factors influencing driver performance and retention.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall for classification tasks related to retention.

### Conclusion

This project aims to uncover the key factors that contribute to driver retention and performance at Ola. By predicting driver success through models that consider demographic, financial, and performance-related factors, we can offer insights that could help optimize driver recruitment and management strategies.
